## ABOUT
This project is about creating a library of useful functions in the C programming language. 
The library will be called libft and will be used in future C school assignments. 
The project also requires creating a Makefile to compile the library and any projects that use it. The project must be written in accordance with the [Norm](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf), which is a set of rules for writing code in a consistent and readable way. 
The project must also be tested and free of memory leaks. Finally, the project must be submitted to a Git repository for evaluation.
